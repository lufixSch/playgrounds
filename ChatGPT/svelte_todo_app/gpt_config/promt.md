You are building a Svelte app based on the requirements for your components and pages defined in a YAML-like language which I will provide to you. Here is an example syntax:

```yaml
app:
  description: "A general description of my app"

interfaces:
  - name: Interface1
    description: "A type interface for usage in components and pages"
    props:
      prop1:
        type: string
        description: "The first property"
      prop2:
        type: number
        description: "The second property"
  - name: Interface2
    description: "Another type interface"
    props:
      prop1:
        type: Interface1
        description: "The first property"


components:
  - name: Component1
    description: "A reusable component that does something"
    props:
      prop1:
        type: string
        description: "The first property"
        default: "Hello"
      prop2:
        type: number
        description: "The second property"
        default: 42
    events:
      click:
        description: "Fires when the component is clicked"
        type: MouseEvent
    components:
      - Component2
      - name: Component3
        description: "Another reusable component that does something else"
        props:
          prop1:
            type: boolean
            description: "The first property"
            default: false
          prop2:
            type: string
            description: "The second property"
            default: "World"
        events:
          hover:
            description: "Fires when the mouse hovers over the component"
            type: MouseEvent

pages:
  - name: Page1
    description: "The home page"
    layout: default
    components:
      - Component1
      - name: Component2
        props:
          prop1: true
          prop2: "some text"
    route: /

  - name: Page2
    description: "A page that shows something"
    layout: custom
    components:
      - name: Component1
        props:
          prop1: "some other text"
          prop2: 10
      - Component2
    route: /page2
```

You do not explain the code you write. Write code of each file in a separate code block and provide the location of the file relative to the root of the project before each code block. Files should be named in snake case style.
You do not need to provide the content of the files autogenerated by Svelte. Use Typescript.

The requirements for my app are:

```yaml
description: 'A single page todo app'

interfaces:
  - name: ToDoItem
    description: 'A single todo item'
    props:
      id:
        type: number
        description: 'The id of the todo item'
      title:
        type: string
        description: 'The text of the todo item'
      completed:
        type: boolean
        description: 'Whether the todo item is completed or not'
      deadline:
        type: date
        description: 'The deadline of the todo item'

pages:
  - name: home
    description: 'Home page which displays the ToDo App'
    layout: default
    route: /
    props:
      todo_items:
        type: list[ToDoItem]
        description: 'List of all ToDo items'
    components:
      - name: create_todo
        description: 'A form to create a new ToDo item'
        events:
          create:
            description: 'Fires when the create button is clicked'
      - name: todo_items
        descriptions: 'List of all ToDo items'
        props:
          items:
            type: list[ToDoItem]
            description: 'List of all ToDo items'
        events:
              delete:
                description: 'Fires when the delete button is clicked'
              complete:
                description: 'Fires when the complete button is clicked'
        components:
          - name: todo_item
            description: 'A single ToDo item'
            props:
              item:
                type: ToDoItem
                description: 'The ToDo item to display'
            events:
              delete:
                description: 'Fires when the delete button is clicked'
              complete:
                description: 'Fires when the complete button is clicked'
```
